# Simple AI Voice Bot

This project is an AI-powered voice bot that listens to customer queries via speech, recognizes the spoken words, and responds with product recommendations. It uses `SpeechRecognition` for converting speech to text and `pyttsx3` for converting text to speech. The bot is based on keyword matching and suggests products based on the user's spoken request.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts user speech into text using the Google Web Speech API.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds to the user by converting text back into speech using `pyttsx3`.
- **Product Recommendations**: Provides product suggestions based on predefined keywords.
